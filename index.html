        <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Humble Philip" width="300">
        <p>Greetings — I’m <strong>Philip Humble Kelsin Lucian</strong>, though many know me as
            <em>Carlineil as my stage name</em>. I’m a programmer, ethical hacker, and poetic creator who finds rhythm
            in code and emotion in logic.
            I love building intelligent systems, breaking digital limits, and crafting words that echo through time.
            I live in Nigeria, where the pulse of innovation drives my passion for technology, music, and storytelling.
            My mission: to blend creativity with code and leave a mark in both worlds — digital and divine.
            Which I'm achieving through my studies in <strong>Web Design and Development</strong> at <em>BYU Idaho</em>,
            where I’m honing my skills to create impactful digital experiences.
            And I am looking forward to a career in cybersecurity, where I can protect and innovate in the digital
            realm. And I'm looking forward to creating my own website and understanding more about the industry.
        </p>

        <p>Nigeria, known as the Giant of Africa, is a nation rich in culture, rhythm, and resilience. From the bustling
            streets of
            Lagos to the calm landscapes of Umuahia, it pulses with creativity, innovation, and a spirit that refuses to
            fade. It is
            a land of diverse languages, vibrant traditions, and brilliant minds shaping the future of technology,
            music, and art
            across the continent.</p>
