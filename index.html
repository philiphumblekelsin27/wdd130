        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Humble Philip" width="300">
        <p>Greetings â€” Iâ€™m <strong>Philip Humble Kelsin Lucian</strong>, though many know me as 
            <em>Carlineil the Dark Angel</em>. Iâ€™m a programmer, ethical hacker, and poetic creator who finds rhythm in code and emotion in logic. 
            I love building intelligent systems, breaking digital limits, and crafting words that echo through time. 
            I live in Nigeria, where the pulse of innovation drives my passion for technology, music, and storytelling. 
            My mission: to blend creativity with code and leave a mark in both worlds â€” digital and divine.
            Which I'm achieving through my studies in <strong>Web Design and Development</strong> at <em>BYU Idaho</em>, where Iâ€™m honing my skills to create impactful digital experiences.
            And I am looking forward to a career in cybersecurity, where I can protect and innovate in the digital realm. And I'm looking forward to creating my own website and understanding more about the industry.
